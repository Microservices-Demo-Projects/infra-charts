# External Secrets Operator configuration
# See README.md for detailed explanation of CRD management
external-secrets:
  installCRDs: true  # Disable CRD installation via Helm (recommended for production)
  # By default, this uses the upstream chart's default behavior. See README.md section "CRD Management" for best practices

# ClusterSecretStore configuration
# This creates a cluster-wide secret store that can be referenced by ExternalSecrets in any namespace
clusterSecretStore:
  required: false
  name: local-vault-backend
  
  vault:
    # Local HashiCorp Vault server address configured with mTLS.
    server: "https://vault.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200"
    
    # Kubernetes authentication method configuration
    auth:
      kubernetes:
        # Mount path where Kubernetes auth method is enabled in Vault
        # This must match: vault auth enable -path=<mountPath> kubernetes
        mountPath: "kubernetes"
        
        # Vault role name for authentication
        # This must match the role created in Vault with:
        # vault write auth/kubernetes/role/<role> ...
        role: "external-secrets"
        
        # Service account used for authentication with Vault
        # This must be the service account created by the external-secrets chart
        # Default is "external-secrets" (the chart's default SA name)
        serviceAccountRef:
          name: "external-secrets"
